    "# Our Question: Among state and city government open datasets hosted on the Socrata portal, what dataset topics are the most popular as of August 2017?\n",
    "\n",
    "## However, this (unfortunately) isn't as easy as choosing a consistent category like \"crime and public safety\" and adding up views and downloads. We have two obstacles:\n",
    "- We need to control for the fact that some datasets just get more views because they are from popular portals. Our goal is determine what *types* of datasets are most popular so all cities and states can use this information. We don't want our conclusion to be that everyone should release data on \"New York Lottery\" (this is not a joke; our initial analysis found that to be a very popular tag).\n",
    "- Datasets themselves vary widely, and not all metadata is standardized or consistent. Some datasets are in broad categories, like annual budget, and some are very niche and specific, like dog licenses. Compounding this challenge is that cities choose all sorts of different tags and categories for similar data; \n",
    "\n",
    "### Therefore, we need a way to extract true topics that cut across multiple cities' and states' datasets.\n",
    "- We want \"budget\", \"fiscal year\" and \"expenditures\" to all be treated as a single topic.\n",
    "- **Fortunately, a machine learning model exists to do just this.** *Latent Dirichlet Allocation* is an algorithm that finds \"hidden\" topics in a group of documents. It posits that each \"document\" (in this case, our combined metadata) is a mixture of topics, and that each word in a document is derived from a topic. LDA will produce \"topics\" composed of words and their expected distribution across that topic. While expected distribution is not very intuitive to interpret, the word combinations in topics is extremely easy to interpret.\n",
    "    - **In order to run LDA on this dataset, we processed our metadata by combining \"description\", \"domain_tags\" and \"categories\" attributes into a new attribute called \"mash\".** Each row of \"mash\" will be a document in our model.\n",
    "        - We excluded dataset name and domain; these are often very specific, parochial tags that will inhibit our efforts to form \"topics\" that can apply across cities and datasets. As we will see later, proper and parochial names skew our model and we want to avoid them."

    "## Building an LDA Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running an LDA model is very computationally intensive as explained below; this is why we did it in a separate notebook. Fortunately, we can save and import models.\n",
    "- When building an LDA model, we pick the number of topics that we want the algorithm to find. This is a very important parameter.\n",
    "- LDA Model fitting is an iterative process. The algorithm starts out by assigning every word to a temporary topic. Then, for *every* word, it updates the topics by calculating:\n",
    "    - How prevalent is that word across topics? Topics with a high prevalance of the word in question get a higher weight for that word's assignment.\n",
    "     - How prevalent are topics within a document? If one topic within a document is more prevalent, it gets a higher weight.\n",
    "     - Based on these two criteria, LDA then updates a word's topic and document assignment.\n",
    "     - **An LDA's topic formations get better the more passes you can run. However, running 60 passes of this dataset's model (we do have a large number of documents, although their word count is relatively low) takes about 35 minutes.** \n",
    "\n",
    "### If we understand nothing else, we need to understand this: LDA is a *probabilistic* model and its results can fluctuate based on small changes in the data and how the model itself randomly assigns topics to begin with!\n",
    "- This is a weakness in our analysis; it is not very replicable. It took several different LDA formations to settle on an ideal number of topics and to get consistently coherent topics.\n",
    "- Our source data changes based on our API call. Our LDA model changes based upon both the source data and the model's probabilistic results itself. **Thus, for stability and replicability, we've saved both a dataframe and an LDA model. These are snapshots in time, not current, definitive structures.**"

    "- The source code for this is in the ipynb \"Original LDA Code - Socrata API Dataset - Gensim LDA Groupings\". **Note that if you run this code yourself (encouraged), you WILL get different results, and perhaps not useful ones**. Finding the right LDA settings for your dataset is time consuming and basically takes trial and error. Again, this is a weakness of our model."

    "This is a very decent topic analysis. By my count, **we've created 48 genuinely useful \"clusters\" of latent topics.** Since topic analysis is probabilistic, and our data contains \"noise\" (that is, words either far too specific or far too common to add real meaning) to begin with, **we have a few topics that won't help us.**\n",
    "- Topic 32 is just too vague. It probably has something to do with some open government performance metrics, but there are no words to really a distinguish it.  This is not a failure of the algorithm; I don't doubt these words really are occuring together alot in the data. But \"open, created, items\" doesn't tell us much.\n",
    "- Topic 24 clearly has to do with some \"special\" software/gis for open data (probably having to do with nursing) -- it looks like through the openmichigan portal. Again, these words are quite likely appearing together. But the practical application of a topic like this when it comes to determinging what is popular in the real world is limited.\n",
    "- Topic 42 has a similar problem to topics 32 and 42 topics, but is a little more clear for content type. It looks like political information for several years. But we can't really tell more specifics.\n",
    "- Topic 43 is what I'd call a \"parochial\" topic; it's clearly about common information like jobs and licensing from new york and michigan. Again, not useful as its own topic - but my spin is that this helps isolate \"new york\" and \"ny\" to keep them from inflating other topic views.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other topics are useful, but may mix content. It could be a vagary of the English language, or it might actually reveal new insights:**\n",
    "- Topic 51 is a topic that tells us something, but it appears to be a mix of youth court cases and youth college enrollment. This could be that \"enrollment\" is used in English in the context of college and court-mandated programs. Then again, this could be \"at-risk youth outcome statistics - either court or college (or both).\n",
    "- Topic 37 appears to be about the construction, permits, and financials of building projects; since these are are pretty closely related in real life, however, I'd argue this is a good topic formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Many topics contain a proper name, but clearly identify something useful:**\n",
    "- Topic 9 -- \"recreation\", \"parks\", \"jersey\", \"park\", \"centers\", \"neighborhood\", \"centers\", etc. is clearly about parks and recreation facilities. It just contains jersey. Because of how we'll award our views/downloads counts to each topic, \"jersey\" should only skew this slightly. Again, this is just \"error\" (but not really error, according to the model - jersey probably had a lot of parks and recreation datasets) we have to tolerate if we can't exclude proper names as stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic 13 has a seemingly weird outlier:**\n",
    "- Topic 13 is clearly about gas & fuel emissions, but also contains \"food\". I'm guessing \"food\" is linked to \"gas\" by the word \"natural\" across many datasets (natural food, natural gas). This is just noise we will have to tolerate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Many topics are absolutely beautiful. A few examples:**\n",
    "- Topic 11 -- energy, environment, electricity, air, sustainable, action, climate, city, clean, facilities -- identifies a city's environmental initiatives with words I wouldn't have even thought of to group together.\n",
    "- Topic 31 -- politics, government, election, campaign, elections, commissions, results, etc -- leaves no doubt about its content.\n",
    "- Topic 5 -- locations, bacteria, hours, culture, county, levels, contact, directory, e [as in e coli], contains -- is amazing. Words that could be all sorts of different topics that become so clear in context together. This is about local bacteria levels! (Presumably in lakes)"

    "**This is very interesting. Our main transportation tag still reigns, but the other transportation tag has fallen completely out of the top 10! Our 311 topic tag still hangs in there, but falls to third versus police records. We can draw a few conclusions from this:**\n",
    "- Transportation, 311/service calls, and police records are resilient; they remain popular across calculations.\n",
    "- Other tags shift rankings significantly. We should be careful about drawing sweeping conclusions from ranks 4-10. \n",
    "    - To begin with, we've sacrificed interpretability to reduce variance in our adjusted popularity calculation. We don't want total views to make NYC datasets the \"most popular\". But by summing log views and downloads, and taking a portion of those views, we've lost some ability to interpret absolute differences in our calculations. A human knows the difference between 1000 views and 10 views; what's the difference between 100,095 adjusted popularity and 92,203? It's not intuitive.\n",
    "    - These results don't mean \"release this open dataset 3rd, then this 4th, etc. It's just a guide to a snapshot of Socrata data at a certain point in time. **As noted, however, it is safe to conclude that transportation plans and operations, along with police records and 311 data, are datasets the public accesses frequently.**\n",
    "- Our \"catch all\" tags seem to get more popular with a stricter cut off. I think it's possible that they match parochial datasets very well, but match fewer datasets as a winner overall. Topics that actually tell us something but are more broad may match datasets less well, but match more (at a 0.3-0.4 threshold), therefore losing some credit with a stricter threshold. This is just speculation, however."

    "### Dampened Popularity Results:\n",
    "Interesting! Our top transportation tag has fallen out of the Top 10. Perhaps California and Texas really were giving it too much of a boost, even with log_views. \n",
    "- We can see that two public safety tags -- I'd call them \"reported crimes\" \"public safety calls\" have taken the top spot. \n",
    "- Our \"Personal Transportation\" topic is #3. \"Personal Transportation and Traffic\" is still a popular topic\n",
    "- Interestingly, business licenses comes in at #5 for the first time.\n",
    "- 311 calls has fallen all the way to #14! **Unsurprisingly, 311 was a top topic in New York City.**\n",
    "- Our parochial datasets have fallen out of the top ranks. This is good.\n",
    "- **The separation between popularity metrics is much smaller and less significant. We should take care in making sweeping conclusions.** Again, we set a 0.2 threshold for this scoring category in winner-take_all. Different scoring could change this."

    "# Conclusions:\n",
    "**How you count \"popularity\" matters.**\n",
    "- Nevertheless, **transportation and crime/public safety dataset popularity is resilient** across different measures of popularity that we've defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When you \"dampen\" the effects of cities/states whose open data portals get a high volume of traffic, popularity rankings change somewhat**. \n",
    "- This suggests that \"popularity\" (as we've defined it) in very large and/or populated areas is different than other areas. \n",
    "- This may be because of a genuine difference in citizen preference, a difference in what data these governments choose to display prominently (everyone care about traffic, but California *really* cares about traffic), or a skew from users across the country and world accessing this data (NYC, for instance, is a popular domain for datasets for data science research projects).\n",
    "\n",
    "**We argue that \"dampened\" popularity is the most appropriate metric for wide applicability to a variety of government organizations**. \n",
    " - It appears to truly reduce the influence of large CA, NYC, and TX datasets. Not that there's anything wrong with these places or portals! But we want this information to be useful to smaller cities as well.\n",
    " - **Using dampened popularity, the following topics show notable popularity:**\n",
    "    - Crime Reports and Public Safety Response\n",
    "    - Personal Transportation and Traffic\n",
    "    - Community Economic Development & Housing\n",
    "    - Business Licensing\n",
    "    - Project Permitting and Financing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Popularity is *always* going to be affected by what a city or state chooses to display prominently on its web portal.**\n",
    "- For example -- using our old metric of popularity, ‘energy environment electricity air sustainable action climate city clean facilities’ was the most popular topic in Providence, RI. Providence, RI displays a link to sustainability info right on its front page. It is hard to tell what is cause and what is effect. \n",
    "- **This is not a controlled experiment. We hope that a sample of 141 open data portals controls enough for individual variation in what datasets are easiest for users to access in a given portal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**No meta analysis alone can tell a city what kind of open data will be most popular, let alone most urgent to the public interest.**\n",
    "- As we saw from our undampened popularity measures, cities have a variety of most popular topics. This is influenced by both local preference and local decisions about what datasets to display prominently.\n",
    "- Just because a dataset is popular doesn't mean it serves the most urgent or broadest public purpose.\n",
    "    - Open data users are not a cross section of voters or the general public. Permitting information is important and useful for developers. It should be open and accessible for concerned citizens as well. But other types of information may be more useful to the average citizen. \n",
    "\n",
    "**These results are only applicable to domains hosted by Socrata. We'd expect that a wider range of cities/states wouldn't alter results that much, but we can't be sure.**"

    "## Caveats\n",
    "### Errors, uncertainty, and additional notes:\n",
    "**Again, not every dataset is tagged thoroughy, accurately, or appropriately.** \n",
    "  - Some cities/portals just give their datasets weird names or use stock descriptions for every single category of open data. That's why we've formed a bland or vague topic or two.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Proper names obviously skew results somewhat; a proper name doesn't really tell us about the content of a dataset.**\n",
    "  - However, it's just not feasible to remove every proper name as a stopword; at least not without extensive trial and error\n",
    "  - \"Dampened Popularity\" best avoids this effect by requiring a cut off (0.2), only counting \"winning\" topics, and normalizing popularity scores *within* a city.\n",
    " \n",
    "**We are only displaying the top 10 words by affinity for each topic. The topics go much deeper, picking up some marginal affinity from words that may not make as much sense to the human eye.**\n",
    "   - This is also a weakness of our model. Real life, human eye topics are of varying length in terms of words. But our model forms topics of equal sizes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Why not KMeans or some other form of clustering to group datasets?**\n",
    "- Those with strong backgrounds in data science may ask why we didn't turn each dataset's \"mash\" into a tf-idf vector and then \"cluster\" datasets based on their distance in mathematical space. We tried! However, the data formed by the tf-idf vectorizer was too sparse. KMeans' explicit number of clusters forced dissimilar datasets together too often. DBSCAN's ability to create clusters of varying density and assign data points to an 'outlier' cluster produced highly specific clusters that didn't cut across cities as much as we'd like. And too often a DBSCAN assigned over half of our datasets to an outlier category.\n",
    "- **We'd encourage those with strong backgrounds in data science and machine learning to take a cut at this. It's possible clustering could still produce useful formations, and it would be a more stable formation our rather reverse process using LDA topic modeling.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The human brain interprets our clusters at the end. It's up to us to determine what our \"topic\" should really be named in human English. Two LDA topics may be very similar real-life topics (we can see this with our two transportation datasets - probably because that's such a prevalent real-life category).** \n",
    "  - Then again, all of this is labeled by humans. Back to our first point, there is always room for disagreement/debate in what \"subject\" a dataset is about, and how narrow to make subjects."
